 For storing data we are using MongoDB.Since this projeect was just for learning purpose so i used MongoDB cloud.It provides 512 Mb of free storage space.
 Steps for db setup:
 1.Login to MongoDB cloud
 2.Create a cluster there
 3.In cluster formed ,go to Collections and create a database.We have to give database and collection name.
 3.User data including user name and password is updated.
